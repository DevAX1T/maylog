## About

mayLOG is a bot to log department actions, monitor department activity, manage department groups, and more.

Version two is open source. You may find [Version One](https://github.com/DevAX1T/mayLOG_V1) here.

mayLOG uses the command system I made for my other bot. It is unfinished but it's stable enough to be used in mayLOG.

## Installation

You need a MongoDB and Redis database to run the bot. I will not offer you help for self-hosting. You also need a custom API system and I am not releasing that.
